A deadlock occurs in Go when two or more goroutines are blocked forever, waiting for each other 
to release resources they need. Deadlocks are a common issue in concurrent programming and are often 
caused by a circular dependency or a synchronization problem between goroutines.

Unbuffered Channels: In unbuffered channels, the sender and receiver must synchronize: the sender blocks 
until the receiver is ready to receive, and vice versa. If neither the sender nor the 
receiver is ready, a deadlock can occur.

Missing Receivers or Senders: If a goroutine expects to receive from a channel, but there's no sender, 
or if a goroutine tries to send to a channel, but there's no receiver, deadlock can occur.

Circular Dependencies: When two or more goroutines depend on each other's resources 
in a circular manner, deadlock can occur if they are not properly synchronized.

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    ch := make(chan int)
    ch <- 42 // Sending to unbuffered channel (no receiver)
    fmt.Println(<-ch)
}

In this code, the main goroutine sends a value into an unbuffered channel (ch <- 42), 
but there's no receiver ready to receive from the channel. 
As a result, the main goroutine blocks indefinitely, waiting for a receiver. 
This situation leads to a deadlock.

Debugging Deadlocks:
Use the go vet tool: Go provides the go vet tool, which can help detect 
potential issues in Go code, including deadlock scenarios.
Use race condition detectors: Tools like go run -race can help detect race conditions
and potential deadlocks during runtime.
In summary, deadlocks are a common issue in concurrent programming, especially in Go. 
Understanding how goroutines and channels work and following best practices for synchronization 
can help prevent and debug deadlock errors effectively.
